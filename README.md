This is a slightly modified app, original by rdinit, that now everyone can use because it adds the possibility to enter a custom HTTP port.

To use the app just open the executable, enter your HTTP port and enjoy. The app remembers your HTTP port for the next time you open it, if you want to change your HTTP port just open the .json file and change the value.
